# d3 algorithms
  
Visualizations for different algorithms in d3.  
  
As of now I have only created one for doing a radix sort on a string  
of characters.  

I plan to extend this to an LSD sort on strings of a  
fixed size using an alphabet of a fixed size.  

Currently working on visualization for the Knuth-Morris-Pratt substring  
search algorithm.
